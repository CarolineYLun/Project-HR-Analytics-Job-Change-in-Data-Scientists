# Project-HR-Analytics-Job-Change-in-Data-Scientists
The project goal is to predict whether a data scientist candidate will look for a new employment or wants to work for the company after training, which helps optimize HR costs and increase efficiencies. By using both descriptive and predictive analysis on a companyâ€™s HR dataset, we seek to interpret affecting factors on employee decisions.
